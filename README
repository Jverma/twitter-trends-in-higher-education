This summer I completed Coursera's Introduction to Data Science taught byProf. Bill Howe, University of Washington. As a part of this course, students were encouraged to participate in real-life projects posted on the forums. Prof. Howe invited organizations and individuals to post research and business problems for the students to work on. 
I worked on a project which involved analyzing twitter contents relevant to higher education. This work was proposed by Coursolve, an organization based in Boston.
